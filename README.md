<p>This repository contains my project completed as part of the <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/certification/sukis/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-v8">JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification</a> from <a href="https://github.com/freeCodeCamp">freeCodeCamp</a>.</p>

<h2>Palindrome Checker Project</h2>

<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>A palindrome is a word or phrase that can be read the same way forwards and backwards, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing. This project involves building an app that checks if a given input is a palindrome.</p>

<h3>Instructions:</h3>
<p>This project was completed following specific instructions provided by freeCodeCamp. The requirements included creating an input element for the text, a button to trigger the check, and a display element for the result. The app ensures that non-alphanumeric characters are removed and case is ignored in the palindrome check.</p>

<h3>Other Projects</h3>
<p>In addition to this project, I have also completed the following projects as part of the JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structure Certification:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Roman Numeral Converter</li>
  <li>Telephone Number Validator</li>
  <li>Cash Register</li>
  <li>Pok√©mon Search App</li>
</ul>

<p>Each project demonstrates various aspects of JavaScript and Data Structures and was completed according to the guidelines provided by freeCodeCamp.</p>
